            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Over 2 years of professional experience as a Data Analyst. Created interactive BI reports for analyzing business metrics in companies such as <a href="https://www.amrest.eu/en" target="_blank">AmRest</a> (brands KFC and Russian Rostic's) and the international logistics company <a href="https://www.cdek.ru/en/" target="_blank">CDEK</a>. Worked with various databases, extensively utilized SQL for writing complex queries, and used Apache Superset, Power BI, and Yandex Datalens for data visualization, as well as Git for version control.</p>
            <p>I am looking for opportunities to work remotely in Europe, where I can apply my experience in data analytics and grow in an international environment. I am eager to contribute to complex projects, propose innovative approaches, and support businesses in making data-driven decisions. I value working with a professional team, transparent processes, and the opportunity to grow alongside the company.</p>
